# ANN2DL Project 2024-2025

Welcome to the repository for our Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning (ANN2DL) project for the academic year 2024-2025. This repository showcases our work on two distinct challenges: **classification** and **segmentation**.

## Project Highlights

- **Course**: Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning (ANN2DL)
- **Year**: 2024-2025
- **Challenges**:
  1. **Classification Task**
  2. **Segmentation Task**
- **Achievements**: Our team achieved the maximum score in both challenges.

## Challenges Overview

### Classification Task

The goal of this task was to develop and train a model capable of accurately classifying input data, the provided images were of blood cells. There were 8 different types.

### Segmentation Task

In the segmentation task, we focused on designing a model capable of pixel-wise segmentation, producing detailed and accurate masks for the given dataset. The images depicted the surface of Mars, and there were 5 different classes.
